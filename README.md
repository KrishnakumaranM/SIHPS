## Problem Title
SIH1392:E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment
## Idea
Design and develop an intelligent web and mobile application that not only locates the nearest certified e-waste collection and recycling facilities but also educates users through interactive pop-ups on the toxic substances inside their devices and the environmental and health risks of improper disposal. A unique feature will allow users to input (or scan) the model of their old device, where the system, using an AI-powered database of electronic components, estimates the recoverable precious metals (gold, silver, copper, lithium, cobalt, etc.), and rewards users with eco-credits. These credits can be redeemed for discounts on sustainable products, public transport passes, or digital wallets, creating a gamified circular economy."

Unique Elements in This Idea
AI-driven Component Estimation: Instead of just listing e-waste points, the system predicts recoverable resources from specific device models. This bridges awareness with tangible value.

Gamified Eco-Credit System: Points are not just symbolic but linked with real-world eco-commerce (transport, shopping, or green brands).

AR/Interactive Education Pop-ups: Instead of plain text, harmful component info shows up in interactive 3D or AR views, demonstrating for example how lead, mercury, cadmium, or microplastics pollute water and soil.

Blockchain-based Transparency (Optional Add-on): Every disposed device entry can be logged on a public blockchain to prevent fake recycling claims and ensure corporates can audit recovery success.

Community Impact Dashboard: Shows aggregate recoveries and carbon footprint savings for a city/locality, building collective responsibility.

How Itâ€™s Unique Compared to Common Recycling Apps
Current apps mainly give locations of e-waste bins.

Your idea instead adds sustainability gamification, AI-predictive recovery insights, and redeemable eco-reward economics, which makes it educational and action-oriented.

## Technology Stack
1.ReactJS and React Native (or Flutter) for the web and mobile app interface.
2.Google Maps API for finding nearby e-waste centers.
3.Node.js or Python backend for handling requests and running AI models.
4.PostgreSQL (user and rewards data) and MongoDB (device and educational info) as databases.
5.Cloud AI services to estimate precious metals in devices.
6.Stripe/Razorpay for redeeming reward points.
7.Optional blockchain for transparency in recycling records.

## Dependencies
Frontend: React or React Native, Google Maps API, Three.js/AR.js for 3D/AR pop-ups
Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AI frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
Payments/Auth: Stripe or Razorpay SDK, OAuth libraries
DevOps: Docker, CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions
